## **Additional Information**
### **"No-Intro" and "Redump"**
No-Intro and Redump are groups that catalog hashes of dumped games for many systems. If "No-Intro" or "Redump" is present in the name of a group of links, it is a collection of the currently best-available ROMs for the system.

### **Locked Internet Archive Items**
Internet Archive restricts items that generate a high amount of traffic from being able to be downloaded without an account to prevent abuse. This is shown with a lock icon beside the file name in the item's file listing.

When accessing the file directly, the following error is shown.

![IALOCKFILE](img/internetarchivelockfile.png)

To download locked items, [register an Internet Archive account](https://archive.org/account/signup).

### **Internet Archive Metadata**
Internet Archive items have metadata files that end in extensions such as `.xml` and `.sqlite`. These files are not important to download but are meant for the website to know what files to display and the reviews of the item.

### **Internet Archive Torrents**
Some Internet Archive items contain torrent files as another download method. However, the torrent's file listing is usually incomplete compared to what is listed on the website. For this reason, it is recommended to use direct downloads with a download manager instead of torrents.

### **Archive File Types (ZIP, 7z, RAR)**
ZIP, 7z, and RAR are archive file types which means they must be extracted. 7-Zip is recommended for extracting these files. Download and install it [here](https://www.7-zip.org/) and run it. Then, open the archive file in 7-Zip or right click on it and go to `7-Zip -> Extract Files`.

## **Bypassing Download Limits**
### **Google Drive**
From time to time when trying to download a file, you may see an error message saying “Download quota exceeded, so you can’t download this file at this time”. The steps to bypass the download quota limit are as follows:

1. Sign in to your Google account or create one, if you have not already.
2. Open Google Drive and go to “My Drive” in the sidebar.
3. Make a new folder. It does not matter what you name it.
4. Go to the quota'd folder, right click on the file you want to download, and click “Add Shortcut to Drive”.
5. Navigate to “My Drive” and then to the folder you made, and click “Add Shortcut”.
6. Go to “My Drive” on the sidebar. Right-click the folder you made and click “Download”.
7. A .zip file with the file(s) you selected starts downloading.

### **MEGA**
MEGA has a 5 GB download limit every 24 hours. To bypass MEGA's download limits, you will need either a VPN or a list of proxies. If you are using a VPN, simply connect to it. If you are using a list of proxies, download [MegaBasterd](https://github.com/tonikelope/megabasterd) and configure it with the list of proxies.
